    audit service stores whatever the caller passed in and never
    backfills from the request credential — callers that want events
    attributed to the calling user or API key must populate the fields
    themselves on ``record(...)``.

    Attributes:
        id (UUID): Server-assigned UUID for this event.
        event_type (str): What happened (e.g. ``"user.created"``,
            ``"invoice.paid"``). Any non-empty string.
        resource_type (str): Kind of resource the event is about
            (e.g. ``"invoice"``). Any non-empty string.
        resource_id (str): Identifier of the specific resource the
            event is about.
        occurred_at (datetime): When the event actually happened, as
            reported by the source.
        created_at (datetime): When the audit service first ingested
            this event.
        actor_type (str | None): Kind of actor that caused the event
            (e.g. ``"USER"``, ``"API_KEY"``, ``"SYSTEM"``, or any label
            the caller chose). ``None`` when not supplied.
        actor_id (str | None): Identifier of the actor that caused the
            event. Free-form — any identifier scheme is accepted.
            ``None`` when not supplied.
        actor_label (str | None): Human-readable label for the actor
            (e.g. an email address or API key name). ``None`` when not
            supplied.
        category (str | None): Free-form bucket label for the event
            (e.g. ``"auth"``, ``"billing"``, ``"config-change"``). Stored
            exactly as supplied; drives the audit log's category filter and

            (:meth:`~smplkit.audit.AuditClient.categories`). ``None`` when
            not supplied.
        data (dict[str, Any]): Free-form per-event payload defined by
            the customer. Surfaced on the audit-event resource as a
            structured JSONB column.
        idempotency_key (str): Customer-supplied dedupe key. Empty when
            the customer didn't supply one.

            forwarder delivery regardless of any matching forwarder
            filter.
        environment (str | None): The environment the event was recorded

            resolves it when the event is recorded (from a
            single-environment credential, or from the runtime SDK's

        description (str | None): Optional free-text description.
        forward_smplkit_events (bool): When ``True``, this forwarder also
            receives platform change events that smplkit records about your
            own resources (flag, configuration, and similar changes). Each
            such event is delivered through every environment this forwarder
            is enabled in, using that environment's resolved configuration.
            Independent of the per-environment :attr:`environments` settings,
            since platform change events are not tied to a deployment
            environment. Defaults to ``False`` — platform change events are
            not forwarded unless you opt in.
        filter (dict[str, Any] | None): Optional JSON Logic expression
            evaluated per event. When set, events that don't match are recorded
            as ``filtered_out`` deliveries instead of being POSTed to the
            destination.

            expression. ``None`` delivers the event JSON as-is.
        transform_type (TransformType | None): Engine used to evaluate
            :attr:`transform`. Must be set whenever :attr:`transform` is set.
        created_at (datetime | None): When the audit service first persisted
            this forwarder. ``None`` for an unsaved instance.
        updated_at (datetime | None): When this forwarder was last mutated.
        deleted_at (datetime | None): Soft-delete timestamp. ``None`` for live
