"""Bounded in-memory buffer + worker thread for fire-and-forget audit emits.

ADR-047 §2.6. The buffer caps at ``MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`` to bound memory
consumption under sustained back-pressure. When full, the oldest queued
event is dropped to make room — recent events are more useful for
debugging than ancient ones, and the loss is acknowledged as part of the
async-emit trade-off.

Retry strategy: exponential backoff with jitter on transient failures
(connection errors, 5xx, 429). Permanent failures (4xx other than 429)
are logged and dropped. The retry budget per item is finite so a single
event can't block the queue indefinitely.

The buffer is HTTP-library-agnostic: ``post_fn`` returns either an
``int`` HTTP status code (when the generated client got a response)
or an ``Exception`` (transport failures, unexpected statuses, etc.).
